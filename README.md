HOW TO PLAY UNO (Cardcade):

1. Setup: The game is played with a special deck of cards. Card on top is placed where it is a numbered card. Each player is usually given seven cards to start off with.

2. Objective: The goal of UNO is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards.


3. Gameplay: The player to the left of the dealer goes first, and the turns proceed clockwise. On your turn, you must play a card that matches the color, number, or symbol of the top card on the discard pile. For example, if the top card is a red 7, you can play a red card or a 7 of any color.

4. Playing a card: When it's your turn, you can play a card from your hand by placing it on top of the discard pile face-up. The card you play must match the color, number, or symbol of the previous card played. If you don't have a playable card, you must draw a card from the deck.

5. Stacking cards: This isn't an official rule but it is what players have loved doing. Players can stack cards. Stacking cards means that the player can draw multiple cards with the same number/symbol. For example, if the last drawn card is a red 7, the player can draw a red 3, a blue 3, and a green 3 all at once.

6. Special cards: UNO has some special cards with unique effects. Here are the most common ones:
   - Skip: When you play this card, the next player in turn is skipped, and it goes to the player after them.
   - Reverse: This card reverses the direction of play. If the play is currently going clockwise, it changes to counterclockwise, and vice versa.
   - Draw Two (+2): When you play this card, the next player in turn must draw two cards from the deck and skip their turn. However, if that player has another Draw Two card, they can play it, forcing the next player to draw four cards and skip their turn. The chain continues until someone cannot play a Draw Two card.
   - Wild: This card allows you to choose the color that continues the play. When you play a Wild card, you must also specify which color (red, yellow, green, or blue) the next player should play.
   - Wild Draw Four (+4): This card has the same function as the Wild card, but it also allows you to choose the color. In addition, the next player must draw four cards from the deck and skip their turn. Similar to Draw Two, if the next player has a Wild Draw Four card, they can play it and make the following player draw eight cards. However, the player using the Wild Draw Four card must have no other playable card to do so.

7. Winning the game: The game continues until one player has successfully played all of their cards. That player is the winner of the game!
